webdesktop
==========

I originally wrote this application in 2002 and am releasing it now as open source for anyone who wants to extend or modify it for their own use.

It provides a simple web browser component that you can set to a URL, position on your screen, and then leave resting in the desktop layer, with optional auto-refresh.
